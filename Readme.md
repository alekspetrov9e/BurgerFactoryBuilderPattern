A local burger restaurant approached you with the request to build a small webshop for them to deliver their burgers. A prototype of the system is to be created, which offers three types of burgers: A standard chicken burger, a standard beef burger, and a special beef burger. There are many different types of burger ingredients available, but not every burger necessarily needs all these ingredients to be made.

For example, the standard beef burger should have only one beef patty and only ketchup as a sauce, as well as American cheese as cheese, iceberg lettuce, a cornichon pickle, and a brioche bun.

For the special beef burger, it requires an additional beef patty, mayo, ketchup and bbq sauce. It also comes with two slices of cheese: Brie and Cheddar cheese. The special beef burger should have a sesame bun, a spicy sour pickle, and romaine lettuce. Both beef burgers should have caramelized onions and beefsteak tomatoes.

The standard chicken burger is different to the beef burgers. It has a chicken patty, a deep fried onion, a cherry tomato, a ciabatta bun, green leaf lettuce, a full sour pickle, gouda cheese, and yellow mustard as a sauce as well as chimichurri sauce.

It should be possible to order custom burgers, as well as to view a list of ingredients that will serve as a basis for Make your own burger offers in the future.
